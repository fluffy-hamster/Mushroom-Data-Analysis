# Mushroom-Data-Analysis

This repo is my final project for UC San Diego's "Python for Data Science" Edx course (https://www.edx.org/course/python-data-science-uc-san-diegox-dse200x).

This project is about using machine learning techniques to classify mushrooms into edible/not edible groups. We then have to present our finding in a powerpoint presentation.

This repo contains:

1) Mushroom Dataset (Which can also be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification)
2) Powerpoint slides -- showcasing findings, conclusions, methodology, etc.
3) Jupyter Notebook  -- This notebook contains all the code used to obtain our conclusions.
